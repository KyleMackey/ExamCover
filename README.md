# ExamCover

A simple cover sheet for assessments that creates N cover sheets, each with a random number for all students taking the assessment.

This relies on a \Repeat command. The cover sheet is replicated N times, where N=number of students taking the assessment.

Students write their name on the cover sheet, and write the random number (located on cover sheet) on the assessment packet. Cover sheets and assessment packets are kept completely separate. This keeps the assessment completely anonymous until grades have been assigned to the IDs. 

**NOTE:** I recommend creating a random ID sheet for each assessment to avoid memorizing student IDs, which may result in the same grading bias that we're trying to avoid in the first place.
