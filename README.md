# ExamCover

A simple cover sheet for assessments that creates N cover sheets, each with a random number for all students taking the assessment.

This relies on a \Repeat command. The cover sheet is replicated N times, where N=number of students taking the assessment.

Students write their name on the cover sheet, and write the random number (located on cover sheet) on the assessment packet.

This keeps the assessment completely anonymous until grades have been assigned to the IDs.

The \Repeat command has been adopted from this source [http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/16189/repeat-command-n-times]. All credit for the \Repeat command should be attributed there.
